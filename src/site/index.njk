The coronavirus pandemic and its devastating economic impacts present an unprecedented opportunity to address this decades-old challenge.</p>

    <p>NRGI blends a targeted focus on resource-rich countries with a responsive approach to seize reform opportunities. The challenges we seek to address are large and complex, so we work in partnership to amplify and leverage the work of others. To sustain reform beyond our interventions, we identify and empower change agents inside and outside of government. We have processes for learning and adaptation, to ensure our continued relevance, responsiveness and impact.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>NRGI recognizes that the mining industry is critical to modern life but that there are changes that the industry can make that will help to reduce its negative impacts. NRGI also gives the impression that it is open to learning from industry in a way that other NGOs do not. This builds trust and makes for a more open conversation.”</p>
