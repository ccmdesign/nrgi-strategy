    <p>However, NRGI balances its engagement across countries where there is openness to reform and the possibility of significant short-term change, with more challenging contexts where the likelihood of immediate success is lower but NRGI’s contribution is potentially more game-changing and the impact for citizens more significant over the long term.</p>
