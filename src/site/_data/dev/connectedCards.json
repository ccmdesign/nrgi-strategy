Governments sign contracts that will not deliver long-term returns and that undermine efforts to prevent social and environmental damage. State-owned enterprises fail to generate financial returns on states’ natural assets. Revenues that could fund economic development and social services go uncollected. Low capacity across these functions leads to suboptimal results.</p><p>Confronting these challenges is at the core of NRGI&rsquo;s mission. In Nigeria, for example, we revealed how the government assigned lopsided oil trading contracts to a few favored companies, <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/publications/nrgi-impact-better-management-nigerian-oil-sales\">scrutiny that helped prompt the government to change</a> how it structures these contracts. In Canada and the European Union, our advocacy with partners led to the implementation of rigorous transparency regulations that have resulted in <a href=\"http://www.resourceprojects.org\">massive amounts of data entering the public domain</a>.</p><p>To generate impactful outcomes in this area, we will focus on laws, regulations and <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/topics/contract-transparency-and-monitoring\">contracts</a>; the award of valuable <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/topics/licensing-and-negotiation\">licenses</a>; <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/topics/tax-policy-and-revenue-collection\">tax systems</a>; economic linkages; and the governance of <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/topics/state-owned-enterprises\">state-owned enterprises</a>.</p>",

In some cases, Dutch disease—the negative consequences that can arise from a spike in the value of a nation’s currency—has stymied industrial development.

Some countries, driven by short-term thinking, instability and conflict, have also consumed excessive portions of resource revenues rather than invest them.</p><p>At NRGI we have leveraged our global research to inform country-specific programming, with our analysis driving technical assistance on <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/publications/fiscal-sustainability-mongolia-2018\">Mongolia's fiscal sustainability</a>, <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/uganda_policypaper_web20140505.pdf\">Uganda's fiscal rules</a>, <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/publications/natural-resource-revenue-sharing\">Indonesia's resource revenue sharing system</a> and <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/analysis-tools/publications/ghana-petroleum-revenue-management-act-back-basics\">Ghana's oil revenue management</a>.

The current crisis serves as a stark reminder for oil- and gas-producing countries of the volatility and limits of the market and of the need for resilient strategies less dependent on these commodities. Countries that remain dependent on fossil fuel exports could find their economies “stranded.” Those whose extractives sector policies and governance choices undermine the growth of renewables at home risk will face dirty, outmoded domestic energy systems that do not meet their own needs; they will miss out on the potential upsides of transition. In somemineral-producing countries, the energy transition can bring new economic opportunities: the world will increasingly demand the minerals needed to expand electric vehicle, wind and solar technologies. Without attention to good governance and strategy, these countries risk repeating the mistakes of past booms, amplifying corruption and local conflict, and creating bottlenecks to the expansionof clean technology globally.</p><p>We will:</p><p>Support the domestic energy transition in countries rich in fossil fuels.</p><p>Help mineral producing countries meet increased demand for critical minerals via policies that promote sustainable economic benefits for citizens, ensure public oversight and reduce risks of corruption.</p><p>Empower oil- and gas-rich countries to develop and implement extractive-sector policies that reduce dependence on fossil fuels,limit the exposure of citizens to negative economic shocks associated with energy transition, and enhance their prospects to prosper as the world evolves.</p>",

Citizens who don’t benefit from their countries’ resource endowments lose faith in their government; this undermines democracy and contributes to political fragility.</p><p>NRGI will address the extractive sector’s capture and corruption challenges.
